Script Description
*****************************

Script:  RADIUSMgmtConfig

Purpose: This script provides an example for configuring an
ExtremeXOS(TM) switch with RADIUS management information.

Remote Authentication Dial IN User Service (RADIUS) is a mechanism
for authenticating and centrally administrating access to network
nodes.  The ExtremeXOS RADIUS client information allows authentication
for access to a switch.  In order for ExtremeXOS to provide this
access, RADIUS must be appropriately configured on the switch.  This
example shows how RADIUS management information is applied to an
ExtremeXOS switch.

Specifically, this example performs the following functions:

  1. Configures the switch with RADIUS server and client IP addresses

  2. Sets the RADIUS server password and encryption mechanism
     specification

  3. Enables RADIUS server management access for the switch
